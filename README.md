### Project Pages

The `gh-pages` branch of a repo is used to generate [project pages](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages#project-pages). These static web pages are served under subpaths of the organization's domain --- e.g., `paypal.github.io/repo-name/`.

The following is a list of known PayPal repos with `gh-pages` branches:
